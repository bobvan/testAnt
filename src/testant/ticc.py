"""
ticc.py — Serial reader for the TAPR TICC time interval counter.

The TICC outputs one line per PPS edge:
    <seconds_since_boot>  chA|chB
e.g.
    402.342588195696 chA
    402.342588174417 chB

Timestamps have 11–12 decimal places.  Older firmware used 12 (1 ps LSB);
newer firmware uses 11 (10 ps LSB).  The counter's single-shot noise is ~60 ps,
so the last displayed digit is noise in either case.
Lines starting with '#' are comments (boot-time header); they are skipped.

Robustness notes:
  - After a power cycle the TICC enters a silent setup mode for ~5-10 s
    before starting timestamp output (like a BIOS waiting for config input).
    The port is open but produces nothing during this window — this is
    normal.  Do not treat it as an error or retry; just wait.  Subsequent
    opens (TICC already in timestamp mode) produce output immediately.
  - reset_input_buffer() on open discards stale OS-buffered lines that
    would otherwise appear as a discontinuity of several seconds.
  - Every line is matched against _LINE_RE before parsing; partial lines,
    corrupt fragments, and buffer artefacts are silently dropped.
